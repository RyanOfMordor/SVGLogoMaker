This application was built to allow web developers to make simple logos for clients and projects so that they dont have to pay or outsource to a graphic designer. It uses inquirer to prompt the user in the command line for how they would like their logo to look using up to three characters, the color of the text, the shape of the logo and the color of the shape. Once all the questions are answered then an SVG file is written using their selections to make the logo.
